            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

baſhfulneſs reſtrains from telling you, how much he loves you? At theſe
words he caſt his Eyes to the ground, and then lift them up to
<hi>Eugenia,</hi> with an aire, that might let her underſtand, what he felt

diſorder, which he had cauſed in his Miſtreſſes ſoul, he
expreſſed his regards with ſo much languiſhing, he preſſed his
ſighs to ſo much purpoſe, that he reduced that innocent thing, to be no

enflamed them yet more, and obliged theſe two hearts, who never had loved any
thing before, to confeſs to one another, that they were taken.</p>
            <p>Ah <hi>Oronces,</hi> ſaid <hi>Eugenia,</hi> after having
received a kiſs from her Lover; do you believe, that we can be ſo happy as
to love ſucceſsfully? The fear that I am in, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not 
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59476:9"/>be, makes me already repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to my ſelf a thouſand
Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which may oppoſe our Love, and fancy a number of Miſchances,
which ill Fortune may expoſe us to.</p>
            <p>We muſt not be ſo fearful, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied our Cavalier, we have
cauſe rather to hope, than fear; for I dare tell you, that I am reſolv'd,
to to neglect all Conſiderations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but thoſe of pleaſing you;
and there is no difficulty, which I will not overcome, to attain and preſerve
a Good, that I prefer before all the Treaſures in the World. Theſe words
were followed by a thouſand kiſſes, and other favours, which altho' they
were not incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with virtue, yet were rather ſtollen, then freely
granted. One embrace followed the other ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it ſeemed as if
they deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to render them Eternal, and as if, finding nothing elſe
grateful to their Hearts, they intended to live <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59476:10"/>only upon
tenderneſs, ſighs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
            <p>In Effect, this life was very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, its being was only in
the moſt tender Amity, that ever had united two hearts, and its nouriſhment
was ſeaſoned with the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent delights, that could charm an
excellent Soul.</p>
            <p>Our Lovers paſt ſome time, by favour of their great Youth, in
this amiable tranquillity, for as much as that their Parents did believe, that
an age, more advanced, would make them change their Sentiments; but they were
deceived in that; for time, far from diminiſhing that Love, which they had
entertain'd in their tender years, made it the ſtronger for their weakneſs,
and rendered it incapable of receiving any alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by inconſtancy.</p>
            <p>Our Lovers, to make good uſe of this interval of Liberty,
neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected nothing that could contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to their Common ſatisfaction;

            <p>The good Intelligence, which had always accompanied the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

            <p>This unhappy Lover made <pb n="29" facs="tcp:59476:17"/>Courting in vain. He
could obtain no love, and his perſeverance was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed only by a
ſtubbornneſs, which he found invincible in <hi>Eugenia,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to love
any thing, but her Dear <hi>Oronces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he knew perfectly, that there was nothing to be done, and
that the Fair one could never be reduced to favour him, he thought of a
retreat, and acquainted <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia's</hi> Parents, with the little
ſucceſs of his enterpriſe, and his deſigne of leaving her.</p>
            <p>Then it was that the Combat grew rough, and that
<hi>Laurentia,</hi> to little purpoſe making uſe of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Authority,
would force her Daughter, to doe that, thorough O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, which ſhe would
not do by Inclination; and knowing, that ſhe had a great averſion for a

un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful, and <hi>Eugenia</hi> proteſted, that <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59476:18"/>though
ſhe had a great Antipathy for a Monaſtick life, yet ſhe would embrace it,
rather than do any thing contrary to the Faith given her Lover, that all
theſe falſe Alarms ſhould work no effect upon her, and that the only way
to retain her in the world, was not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex her in an Honourable Love,
which might prove Glorious to her Family: That in all other things, ſhe would
have for her Mother all the reſpect poſſible; but in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire, that
concerned the Liberty of her Perſon, ſhe deſired, that ſhe might not be
made unhappy, by any evil engagement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laurentia</hi> ſaid to her, all that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger could inſpire
a provoked Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: She threatned her with the loſs of her Favour, and gave
her only one whole Week to reſolve upon the choice, either of a
<hi>Cloyſter,</hi> or of Him, whom ſhe had propoſed to her for an
Husband. That afflicted Mother had no real deſigne of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing 
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59476:18"/>her to quit the World, ſhe was
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lattered her
ſelf, that the only means to be obeyed, was to act after that manner, and
that ſhe would ſooner make choice of a Marriage with <hi>Dorimont,</hi>
than of a Voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement in a place, which ſhe could never approve
of.</p>
            <p>While theſe affairs paſt thus, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronces</hi> had an
Employment in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> conformable to his Age and Birth, he
acquitted himſelf of it, with the approbation of all thoſe who knew him,
and they admired that courage, which he made appear in the moſt dangerous
aſſaults, and which accompliſht the moſt difficult Enterpriſes.
Whatever diverſions theſe Exerciſes might give his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet he
could not loſe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his Dear Miſtreſs. He thought of her night
and day, and the exceſs of his Paſſion made him long for a Peace, ſo
that there might be a poſſibility of his enjoying her, <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59476:19"/>whom he loved, more then his life.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the time, given <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> to determine her

and, that ſhe might no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

change, and were yet much more ſurprized, when they ſaw that it was real,
and that <hi>Eugenia</hi> did earneſtly demand the favour, of being received
into the number of <hi>Novices,</hi> and that they would grant her the habit of
the Religion.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:59476:20"/>
            <p>She had not any real deſigne to engage her ſelf; but did this,
only to make her Mother believe, that no other return was to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from
her, nor any thing elſe to be hoped for; for, unleſs ſhe ſhould be
replaced in her former liberty, ſhe would perhaps loſe it forever, by
Profeſſing in that houſe.</p>
            <p>Her Solicitations were ſo earneſt, and her fervour ſo
ſurprizing, that the Superiour inveſted her in the habit of the Religion,
and believed that ſhe could not, without oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the will of Heaven,
refuſe it to the extraordinary Zeal of the Demandant. This young
<hi>Novice</hi> made a Friend-ſhip with the whole Convent: She was Fair, like
an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and her voice, which, as I have already told you, was charming,
raviſhed the hearts of her Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when her Office obliged her to
ſing.</p>
            <p>

penetrated the hearts of thoſe, that beheld her. She performed all her

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59476:21"/>ſhe gained the Affections of thoſe, that converſed
with her.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, her Mother, who ſaw no change in her
Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, informed the Superiour of all that paſt, and knowing that the
Religious have a wonderful addreſs in the managing our Spirits, ſhe
intreated her aſſiſtance, to reduce <hi>Eugenia</hi> to the Obedience,
due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Her; and alſo, that ſhe would not be ungrateful for her cares
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, eſpecially if they produced ſome happy ſucceſs.</p>

<hi>Laurentia</hi> had informed her of, and applied her ſelf only, to encline
her to make Profeſſion, when time ſhould come.</p>
            <p>She had already borne the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of <hi>Novice</hi> ten Months,
when her Lover, who knew nothing of all this, writ to her from
<hi>Flanders,</hi> where having found no particular <pb n="37" facs="tcp:59476:21"/>opportunity to ſend his Letter, he committed it to the Hazard of the

            <p>This was accompanied by a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Letter from a Chirurgeon,
which was filled with all the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Fight, and the nature of
his wounds; it ſhew'd, how he had expired three Hours, after he had writ the
Billet, and how he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Commiſſion to ſend it to Her, to whom it
was directed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laurentia</hi> doubted not, but that this Artifice would
ſucceed to her advantage, and that her Daughter, ſeeing her ſelf
diſengaged by her Lovers death, from all Proteſtations made to him, would
make no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of accepting, whom ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and giving her heart to
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Affections; but alaſs, that poor Mother had the diſpleaſure of
ſeeing all her Projects without ſucceſs, and this innocent deceit had no
other conſequence, than her loſs by the very meanes, that were intended for
her preſervation.</p>
            <p>The time of <hi>Eugenia's</hi> Profeſſion approacht, when
ſhe received the <pb n="41" facs="tcp:59476:23"/>Letter and Billet ſpoken of. She had
no ſooner read them, but ſhe fell into a Swoone, and made thoſe, who were
preſent, take notice, that ſhe had not intirely quit all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Inclinations, by entring into a <hi>Cloyſter.</hi> She was ſo readily
relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ſhe ſoon came to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again, but it was only to
aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don her ſelf to tears and ſadneſs, and to deplore his death, who was
ſtill alive.</p>
            <p>In this deplorable Eſtate, ſhe raiſed the compaſſion of
all her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, they heard, with a great deal of feeling, all the
complaints, that proceeded from the heart, but they were not able to comfort
her in that extream ſorrow. This News made ſuch a diſorder in her minde,
that ſhe remained for ſome time as it were ſenſleſs, and then it was,
that ſhe reſolved not to part from the place, where ſhe was, but to bid
Adieu to the World, ſince it had now nothing in it, that <pb n="42" facs="tcp:59476:24"/>ſhe ought to Love; and to carry all her life, under the habit of a
Cloyſter, the Mourning, which ſhe owed her Lovers Memory.</p>
            <p>The Superiour of the Monaſtery made uſe of that vexatious
minute, to ſpeak to her <hi>Novice</hi> of her Vows. She told her with a mild
and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging Aire, that ſhe ſhared very much in her Affliction, and that
ſhe did not blame the Tears, given to the remembrance of an Honourable amity,
which ſhe had had for the Perſon whom ſhe lamented; but that ſhe ought,
after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that accident with the Eyes of the Body, regard it
alſo with the Eyes of the Spirit, and think, that it was only a blow from
God, who intended, by that means to withdraw her from the World, and make her
one of his Chaſt Eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Eugenia,</hi> having already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that reſolution in

ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing leſs from a Perſon whom ſhe had made a Confident of her
Deſignes; and whom, ſhe did believe, ſhe had engaged to her ſide. She
expreſſed her aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and declared to her, that ſhe would be

Profeſſion without her conſent, <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59476:25"/>and that ſhe would

               </gap>f ſhe
would any way oppoſe her will.</p>
            <p>The Superiour made anſwer, that ſhe had ſeen in
<hi>Eugenia</hi> ſo great a diſpoſition to the life, ſhe would
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, that ſhe thought it impoſſible to diſſwade her from it,
without oppoſing the Ordinance of Heaven; that ſhe had no other Proſpect,
and that Human Intereſt had the leaſt ſhare in it. This ſaid, ſhe
took leave of <hi>Laurentia,</hi> and called her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to her, whom ſhe
left alone in her Company.</p>
            <p>The Afflicted Mother was quite tranſported at the ſight of
<hi>Eugenia,</hi> and with tears asked her, if it was true, that ſhe would
continue in that Monaſtery? If ſhe did, that it was the way to kill her
with diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and that ſhe ought to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great
obligation, which ſhe owed her. She uſed the ſtrongeſt Arguments, that
tenderneſs could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire her with, to move the heart <pb n="46" facs="tcp:59476:26"/>of that Rebel (it was ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhe called her) but it was
without effect and all that ſhe could get from her was, that it was by her
Order only, that ſhe entered that place. That ſhe was reſolved never to
quit it, and that ſhe deſired to make her Vows only, that ſhe might not
be far from her Vocation. Theſe words ſo contrary to her Mothers wiſhes
were followed by a thouſand Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, and made <hi>Laurentia</hi>
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that we often hazard the loſs of all, when we would gain too
much.</p>
            <p>Then ſhe retired very much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and went to take
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Learned, how ſhe might bring about her enterpriſe. They
repreſented to her, that ſhe had no great cauſe to be troubled; for the
Religious never do any thing for nothing, and that ſhe need only give her
Daughter no Portion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly to prevent her Profeſſing.</p>
            <p>This Proceeding was indeed the <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59476:26"/>beſt,
according to the Ordinary Rules; but she good qualities of the <hi>Novice,</hi>
together with a conſiderable ſum of Money, which her kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, who, by her
engagement, would become Heirs to her Eſtate, underhand gave, did break all
theſe juſt meaſures: They prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other conſiderations,
and <hi>Eugenia</hi> Profeſt after the accuſtomed manner.</p>
            <p>While theſe things paſt, Our <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier</hi> began to be
tired with the War: He an hundred times a day called to his mind the amiable
qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of his Miſtreſs: He remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the Amorous favours, which
he had received, and in that agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able contemplation, he almoſt died with a
deſire, of ſeeing her again. Whilſt he thus ſighed, they brought him a
Letter which, after reading, almoſt drove him to deſpair. One of his
Friends acquainted him, that the report of his Death was every where ſpread
abroad, that <hi>Eugenia,</hi> 
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:59476:27"/>to avoid conſtraint from
her Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who would force her to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Dorimont,</hi> had embraced
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and had made her Vows, and that it were proper, he ſhould write
himſelf, to let her underſtand of his being in health, leaſt they might
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail by the falſeneſs of the firſt News, which they had Publiſhed
of him.</p>
            <p>I leave you to Judge the exceſs of grief, which touched the
heart of our Lover, when he underſtood, that he had loſt his Miſtreſs.
He could not imagine, that ſhe ought to fly to that Extremity, for any
reaſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Nevertheleſs he could not be perſwaded, that ſhe
wanted fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to him. In this perplexity he thought it neceſſary to have

you ſhould have preſerved your ſelf for</hi> Oronces. <hi>I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſſemble with you, I know not what Opinion, I ought to have of all this,
and whether, I ſhould regard you, as a Perſon inſenſible, who pleaſe
your ſelf at the misfortunes of others, or as a weak inconſtant creature,
paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated for ſome trifles of Devotion, who love every thing, that you
ſee, who forget that which is no longer in ſight, and give up your Heart,
to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, that demands it. I know very well, that abſence is a dangerous
thing, but alas! if I were abſent, it was for loving you, you know that my
paſſion was Innocent, and Pure, you ſhould not then have rendered it
Criminal, by infidelity, while on my ſide, I render it Illuſtrious by an
inviolable conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; acquaint me, as ſoon as poſſible, if

            <p>This Letter, was put into her own hand, by the Gentleman, we
mentioned; it produced, in the Soul of our young Profeſt, very very different
Motions, for ſhe was equally toucht with Grief, and Joy, and in that moment,
perceived the Reliques of the Fire, to rekindle in Her, which were almoſt
extinguiſh't.</p>
            <p>If her Joy was great, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that He, whom ſhe loved,
was living, ſhe conceived no leſs diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to ſee her ſelf
tied, and bound, and, according to all appearance, a Captive for the reſt of
her days; that Reflection cauſed in her, an extream Melancholly, and raiſed
troubles in her Spirit, which tormented her to the Quick.</p>
            <p>She endeavoured to get out of that confuſion, and to enjoy her
former tranquillity, by overcoming <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59476:28"/>her Nature, and
maſtring her Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for her Lover; She believed, that Meditation, and
the Devout Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of ſeveral Pious Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the exerciſe
of a ſevere Virtue, might take her off from theſe Sentiments of the World,
and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtial thoughts, by approaching Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. She therefore made a Tryal
of this for ſome days, but it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any profit. Devotion was to her,
an Inſipid Dainty, which ſhe could not at all Reliſh. She in vain forbid
Love an entrance into her heart,

conſtrained her to yield <pb n="52" facs="tcp:59476:29"/>and ſtill to nouriſh in her
Soul, the ſame Paſſion, which had made her ſigh ſo often
heretofore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenia,</hi> then finding her ſelf too weak to reſiſt
this little God, that attacked her, abandoned her ſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to his
conduct, and writ to <hi>Oronces</hi> the moſt paſſionate Letter, that
her <hi>Genius</hi> could dictate; ſhe informed him of her Mothers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
and conjured him to ſeek ſome remedy, for an evil, that in its ſelf
ſeemed irrecoverable, that ſhe was altogether His; and that Love of him
only had obliged her to embrace the Condition, wherein ſhe ſaw her ſelf
unhappily engaged.</p>
            <p>I leave you to judge, how this Letter was received by our young
Lover; without reflecting upon his Miſtreſſes condition, he was
exceſſiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> glad to hear,

               </gap> 
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:59476:29"/>whereof the thought only tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him wih Pleaſure:
Nevertheleſs, this Extaſie, being ill grounded, continued not long: it gave
place to more ſerious conſiderations, and was followed by an extraordinary
Melancholly, which repreſented to him, that the loſs of <hi>Eugenia</hi>
was without recovery, and that it was impoſſible to repair it.</p>
            <p>While this inquietude afflicted his mind, he wholy applied
himſelf to find out means of getting <hi>Eugenia</hi> into his
poſſeſſion; He preſently thought of ſtealing her away, which would
have been without doubt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, ſince ſhe, without any great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
would have conſented to it; but many conſiderations diſſwaded him from
it; and made him reject that Expedient, for fear of not being able to make
uſe of it, but with prejudice to his Miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>At length after much conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Love inſpired him with an
Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which at the ſame time, was the <pb n="54" facs="tcp:59476:30"/>moſt
pleaſant, and moſt raſh in the World.</p>
            <p>He underſtood, that a young Gentleman, one of his intimate
Friends, called <hi>Camillus,</hi> had made a cloſe Familiarity with a young
<hi>Nun</hi> of that Country, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for him ſo great an
affection, that ſhe would have followed him all the World over: her name was
<hi>Aurelia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oronces</hi> made a confidence to this Cavalier of his ancient
Paſſion for a Miſtreſs, who by a Mothers Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem was blindly ſhut
up in a <hi>Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> for the reſt of her days; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to
ſerve him, in that affaire, from which he himſelf could draw nothing, but
advantage.</p>
            <p>Then he propoſed to him his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, and told him, that to
bring it ſuccesfully about, he muſt obtain leave, for ſiſter
<hi>Aurelia</hi> to change her Convent, ſo that ſhe might go and remain in
that, where <hi>Eugenia</hi> was, and that if this could be done, as it 
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59476:30"/>was apparently poſſible, they Two ſhould be the
moſt happy Lovers, that ever were in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Camillus</hi> became of his Friends o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and told him,
that he would ſpeak of it to his Miſtreſs, without whom nothing could be
performed. But alas! how weak is a young heart, when it ſuffers it ſelf to
be conducted by Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelia,</hi> far from examining, with the Scruple, which
ſhe ought, the Propoſition made to her, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately conſented unto it,
and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the project; admiring, that <hi>Oronces,</hi> in ſo tender
an age, ſhould be capable of imagining ſo witty a contrivance.</p>
            <p>Then our two Lovers met again, and <hi>Camillus</hi> gave an
account of his viſit to our Cavalier. Both obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from their General upon
a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent pretence, leave to withdraw, and they ſeriouſly applied
themſelves to ſucceed in their deſigne. It being unfit, that they
ſhould appear to <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59476:31"/>have any intereſt in the retreat of
Siſter <hi>Aurelia,</hi> they left her to act all alone, and ſupplied her
with the ſure means of obtaining her requeſt, feeing underhand the
perſons, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſollicite the fair <hi>Nun's</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition.</p>
            <p>The Town, wherein ſhe was, had been conquered from the King
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Spaine,</hi> and
thereupon it was, that ſhe grounded her requeſt. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented with a
great deal of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Ingenuity, that ſhe had ever born an inclination
to the <hi>French</hi> intereſt, and more particularly ſince His Majeſty
became Maſter of the Town, wherein the Monaſtery ſtood; but that, ſarr
from gaining the love of her Superiours, by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Obedience which ſhe paid her Prince ſhe was
become the hate of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whole
Convent, that they reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her as a ſtranger, and that thoſe that
Govern'd, being ſtill <hi>Spaniard</hi> in their hearts and affections,
mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> her ſuffer a
thouſand torments, from <pb n="57" facs="tcp:59476:31"/>which ſhe could not be
delivered, but by quitting the place, from whence ſhe humbly prayed to
retire.</p>
            <p>This pretence, being ſpecious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and theſe reaſons
having ſome appearance, ſhe eaſily obtained her wiſh, but not without
ſpecial regard being had, that <hi>Eugenia</hi>'s Convent, to which ſhe was
to go, was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the ſame Rule, as That, which ſhe was to quit; and
there was no other difference, but that in This, wherein <hi>Aurelia</hi> was,
they wore a little white ſcarfe upon their Habit, which the others obſerved
not. But this diſtinction, not being eſſential, they without difficulty,
gave her all the neceſſary Orders for her departure.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, theſe two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers conſulted together, of
what they had to do <hi>Oronces,</hi> following the <hi>Genius</hi> that
puſht him on, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to take <hi>Aurelia</hi>'s Habit, and to go in that
manner, to ſhut himſelf up in a <hi>Cloyſter,</hi> with his Miſtreſs;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59476:32"/>and <hi>Camillus,</hi> making uſe of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
and good will of his Miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, deſigned to conduct her into a
<hi>Caſtle</hi> of his own, and to live there, as Lovers, as long as
Deſtiny would be favourable to them.</p>
            <p>This ſo bold a Metamorphoſis was performed, as it had been
projected. <hi>Aurelis,</hi> having departed by the way of the Coach, and
knowing the place where the two Cavaliers waited for her, did on the ſecond
day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be diſtempered with that way of travelling, and ſeemed not
able to continue without danger her journey, without ſome other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency.
She plaid her part ſo well, that nothing was ſuſpected, and the Coach
arrived at the place, where <hi>Oronces</hi> and <hi>Camillus</hi> had already
taken up their Lodging, There our <hi>Nun,</hi> having agreed for a Litter, did
on the morrow diſmiſs the Coach, after ſhe had ſatisfied the
Coachman.</p>
            <p>It was here, that both parties made a Voluntary change of Habits,
<hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronces</hi> 
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59476:32"/>was but eighteen years old, he was fair
like <hi>Aurelia,</hi> and almoſt of the ſame Stature, ſo that there was
ſuch a reſemblance between them, that the diſguiſe was never known to
any, but thoſe who were privy to it, who could not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently admire at
their behaviour, which appeared not more unnatural, then if both the one and
the other had been born in the Eſtate, in which they were at that time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oronces,</hi> thus traveſtied into a <hi>Nun,</hi> and
furniſhed with all the diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es neceſſary to his new condition,
prepared himſelf to depart in the Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, accompanied only by a Girle, whom
he took in the Town, to render his conduct irreproachable; he was inſtructed
in every thing, neceſſary for his knowledge, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the
Superiour, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Voice very ſweet, and very pleaſant, he
perſwaded himſelf, that he could eaſily live in that Houſe, and perform
all the Exerciſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59476:33"/>to the Habit, which he
wore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Camillus,</hi> for his part, conducted the fair
<hi>Aurelia</hi> into a very pleaſant Caſtle, where he propoſed to
himſelf to enjoy with her ſolid Pleaſures; and, wiſhing to his friend
all content, never to be diſturbed by any unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen misfortunes; they
parted, after having exchanged a thouſand Marks of Affection, and ſetling a
ſure means of holding a correſpondence with one another. Our Fair
<hi>Nun,</hi> impatient to ſee her, whom ſhe loved, ſo haſtned her
departure, and continued her journey with ſo great diligence, that within
three days ſhe arrived at the Town, where ſhe was to remain.</p>
            <p>She went immediately to make a viſit to the Biſhop of the
place, who was the Chief Superiour of <hi>Eugenia</hi>'s Monaſtery; ſhe
ſhew'd him her Obedience, and her other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, wherewith ſhe was
furniſht; She did him reverence with ſo much Grace, ſhe ſpoke to him
with ſo much Modeſty, and always enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd <pb n="61" facs="tcp:59476:33"/>him ſo
wittily, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late was charmed with her, and was overjoyed with
himſelf, that ſo Fair a Perſon rendered her ſelf ſubject to his
obedience, and came to place her ſelf under his direction.</p>
            <p>He was too much taken with the fair qualities of our
Metamorphoſed Cavalier, (whom for the future we ſhall call
<hi>Aurelia</hi>) to permit her ſo ſuddainly to ſhut up her ſelf in the
<hi>Cloyſter,</hi> he would for three or four days have her walk in his Coach
about the Town, and make her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with other Monaſteries, with whom
ſhe might, for the future, have ſome Communication. <hi>Aurelia,</hi> who
had reaſon to fear every thing in a place, where ſhe was ſo well known,
did for a while refuſe thoſe marks of goodneſs, which ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from her Prelate, telling him, that ſhe deſired nothing, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
and that, being entered into Religion very young, ſhe had no manner of
Reliſh for affairs of the <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59476:34"/>World, whoſe faſhions ſhe
was even ignorant of. Therefore ſhe intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to excuſe her, and to
grant her Leave to retire to her <hi>Cloyſter,</hi> that ſhe might there be
at leiſure for exerciſes, more conformable to her Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>This young Prelate had no regard to the entreaties of our
Religious. He did not believe, that her heart had any ſhare, in what ſhe
ſeemed to deſire, and he could not perſwade himſelf, that a Lady, ſo
fair, ſo wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and whoſe Eyes were ſo filled with fire, did deſpiſe
that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with ſuch earneſtneſs, ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He therefore
ſhew'd her all the fine things, and curioſities of the Town. In all her
viſits ſhe gained a general applauſe; her behaviour in them appeared ſo
free, and diſaffected; her words ſo noble, and elevated; and her judgment
ſo ſolid, that ſhe gained the hearts of all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſhe came
into.</p>
            <p>The time of his abſence from the <pb n="63" facs="tcp:59476:34"/>Province,
having a little changed his Meen, and the diſguiſing of his Sex under a
Petti-coat and Vail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not imagined by any, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved himſelf from
being known, even by thoſe, who had been his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate acquaintance, and
ended all his viſits, without being diſcovered, or in the leaſt
ſuſpected by thoſe, who were his neareſt relations.</p>
            <p>This will not ſeem incredible to thoſe, who ſhall reflect on
the many adventures, happening every day, by which we are ſo eaſily
ſurprized; and if, in a Comedy, a Player, whom we have already ſeen,
becomes afterwards unknown, by the change of his Part and Garments, why
ſhould it be difficult, to believe the ſucceſs of a Stratagem, perfectly
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and executed with a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous audacity?</p>
            <p>The Biſhop, having ſpent three days in walking up and down, as
well for his own particular content, as for the ſatisfaction of
<hi>Aurelia,</hi> 
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:59476:35"/>he himſelf conducted her into the
Monaſtery, and did himſelf the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to repreſent unto the Convent a
perſon ſo amiable and accompliſh't.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Abbeſs,</hi> who had heard the News of her departure,
and arrival, received her with incredible tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of Joy; and the other
<hi>Nuns,</hi> at the ſight of ſo much Beauty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for her
preſented to them, an interiour Friendſhip not to be expreſſed. She
thanked the Prelate, with much reſpect, for thoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his
goodneſs towards her, and he, for his part, giving her a Paſtoral Kiſs,
and taking her into his protection, recommended her, as his own Daughter, to
the Superiour, and left her with her Companions.</p>
            <p>It was then, that Embraces were redoubled, and Kiſſes given
without Number; never was Reception ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſo many
Careſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelia</hi> was all on Fire, and the colour, which enlivened
her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, added an agreeableneſs, <pb n="65" facs="tcp:59476:35"/>which render'd
her ſo amiable, as that ſhe raviſhed their hearts. In the mean time,
<hi>Eugenia</hi> appeared not in the Troop; ſhe was become ſo ſolitary
and melancholly, after the News, which ſhe had received about
<hi>Oronces,</hi> that ſhe was indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent for all things, and employed her
thoughts only in Vexation and Diſpleaſure, for having unhappily engaged her
ſelf by a ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and publick declaration of her Vows.</p>
            <p>Her Lover was no leſs unquiet, not to ſee Her, whom he loved
ſo tenderly. She had no manner of notice of his deſignes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when ſome of her Companions advertiſed her of the arrival of Siſter
<hi>Aurelia,</hi> ſhe made no other anſwer, but that ſhe ſhould have
time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſee and ſalute her, ſince ſhe was to remain in the
Houſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Superiour, according to cuſtom, cauſed
all the Siſters to be called together, to the <pb n="66" facs="tcp:59476:36"/>publick
reading of <hi>Aurelia</hi>'s Patents, and to receive her, according to Form,
into the number of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. <hi>Eugenia</hi> was then preſent with the
others, and while one of the Ancients red the diſpatches, and that the other
Formalities were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſhe had her eye continually upon this new
Commer, but ſhe little thought, that ſhe beheld her Lover.</p>
            <p>After the Ceremony was over, <hi>Oronces</hi> received freſh
kiſſes from the Company, but he found none ſo ſweet, as that which his
Miſtreſs gave him. He could not refrain from claſping her more
amorouſly, than he did the others, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he did not deſign to
diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf ſo ſoon to her, he could not forbear a certain
whiſper, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſome glances, which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated the heart of that
lovely Creature.</p>
            <p>The poor Lady, agitated with a thouſand thoughts, retired
immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into her Chamber, to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <pb n="67" facs="tcp:59476:36"/>of what ſhe
had ſeen, and to reflect upon the reſemblance of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia</hi>'s face
to her Dear <hi>Oronces.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, ſhe durſt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of what, her heart declared to her, and though ſhe had been moved with an
infinite tenderneſs, at the time ſhe was embraced, yet a deſigne, ſo
hardy and ſurprizing, could not enter her thought. In this embarras, and
confuſion of Spirit, ſhe ſlumbered, and her mind, being filled only with
the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, that was between <hi>Aurelia</hi> and <hi>Oronces,</hi>
ſhe continually drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of that Subject. Let us leave her in this moment of
repoſe and tranquillity, to ſee what her Lover does.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelia</hi> was all his time enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a <hi>Nun,</hi>
who finding in her ſelf a great inclination to love her, reſolved with the
firſt to gain her Heart, and Friendſhip. She was young and fair, and
<hi>Oronces</hi> was not inſenſible, but, his Affections 
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59476:37"/>being already placed, he made no return of real Love or
Tenderneſs, but only of a little outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Nun,</hi> who was called <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia,</hi> never found
in her ſelf ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a deſire to love one, of her own Sex, as ſhe did
in reſpect of this new Commer; and this Love, appearing to her innocent, and
impoſſible to have in it any thing impure, ſhe puſht it on, as far as
ſhe could, and, knowing by experience, that the Night was more proper than
the Day for a thouſand amorous decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and an infinity of engaging
wantonneſſes, ſhe proffered <hi>Aurelia</hi> to paſs it with her, in
one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chambers, becauſe as yet there was no particular one,
provided for her.</p>
            <p>All theſe Careſſes, enough to have tranſported with joy,
any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that had ſence, gave <hi>Aurelia</hi> but a ſlender
ſatisfaction. She did indeed find her ſelf a little warmed 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59476:37"/>but ſhe needed only think upon <hi>Eugenia,</hi> to
quench immediately thoſe Flames, which begun to blaze. Nevertheleſs, ſhe
could not forbear telling <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> that her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would be very
agreeable unto her, and that ſhe received extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary pleaſure in her
converſation: But that which gave her no ſmall content, was, to hear from
this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, a recital of every thing that had paſt, concerning her
Miſtreſs, who being one of <hi>Pamphilia</hi>'s intimate Friends, had made
her a Confident of it all, and had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to keep it ſecret, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
it to none.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oronces,</hi> who almoſt died with a deſire of ſpeaking
to <hi>Eugenia,</hi> took thence an occaſion of asking <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia,</hi>
where was her Chamber? and told her, that ſhe would be glad to go along with
her, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit that amiable <hi>Nun.</hi> Then <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia</hi> conducted
him thither, and immediately left them together, to <pb n="70" facs="tcp:59476:38"/>the
end, that they might be the more eaſily engaged in a Common amity, wherein
ſhe might have a part.</p>
            <p>Our Metamorphoſed <hi>Cavalier,</hi> for all his
Miſtreſſes Melancholly, found her fairer, then ever, he had ſeen her,
even in her richeſt Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Her youth inſpired him with Joy, her Beauty
with new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and what ſhe had done for him with admiration. He at
firſt diſſembled, who he was, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from her, that ſhe was
newly riſen from ſleep, and that ſhe had had a Dream, which, while it
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, gave her a great deal of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but, after awakening, created
nothing in her, but diſquiet. He preſt her to declare it, and told her,
that he would ſhew the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, if it had the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
with reaſon. She immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately gave him a look, and their Eyes meeting
together, ſaid in their Language, that Love was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, and that
they could not <pb n="71" facs="tcp:59476:38"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ong be unknown to one another. Nevertheleſs
<hi>Eugenia,</hi> being the more fearful, did not dare to declare her thought
firſt, and <hi>Oronces,</hi> who took pleaſure in ſeeing her in that
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, made no great haſt to draw her out of it.</p>
            <p>In fine, Love overcame Affection; <hi>Aurelia,</hi> or rather our
<hi>Cavalier,</hi> could no longer reſiſt thoſe tender motions, which the
preſence of his dear Miſtreſs made him reſent. He
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aſt himſelf about her

               </gap>tis I,
<hi>Eugenia;</hi> and Love has given me the Habit, which you ſee. That word,
chaſing all doubt from <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>'s mind, repleniſhed her with an

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nconceivable

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he felt.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they had recovered <pb n="72" facs="tcp:59476:39"/>their
ſurprize, they began again their Careſſes; and <hi>Oronces,</hi> to take
<hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> out of pain, related to her, how every thing paſt, and that
they had no cauſe to apprehend any thing, as long as his youth would leave
his chin unfurniſhed, and as the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his voice would continue.
She for her part, acquainted him, with the Artifice, which her Mother made
uſe of, to abuſe her, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him to behave himſelf diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in regard of the Convent, leaſt that, by ſome wrong ſtep, he might
ſpoil an enterprize, that required all the good conduct imaginable, to make
it ſucceed.</p>
            <p>She inſtructed him moreover i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <hi>Novices,</hi> when their ordinary Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, <pb n="73" facs="tcp:59476:39"/>who was very Aged, could not attend
that exerciſe, by reaſon of indiſpoſition.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the promiſe, which he had made
<hi>Pamphilia</hi> to paſs the night with her, troubled him not a little. He
told in <hi>Eugenia,</hi> who could find no ſurer means to prevent it, then
by offering the ſame thing in the others preſence; an opportunity ſo to
do preſented it ſelf immediately, for <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to
ſee <hi>Aurelia</hi> again, went and rejoyned them in a Friends Chamber, who
told her, as ſoon as ſhe entered, that ſhe would not quit
<hi>Aurelia</hi> before the morning, and that, being for that day exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from aſſiſting in the Quire, ſhe would keep her company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pamphilia</hi> for her part alledged, that ſhe had made the
firſt proffer; that the Bed, wherein they were to ly, was too little for
three, and that ſhe muſt yield to her, as to one who was her elder. But
<hi>Eugenia</hi> 
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:59476:40"/>was too much intereſſed, to let her
gain that point, Therefore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion was, that they ſhould
accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate themſelves as well as they could, and that both ſhould take
care to divert the new Comer.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, nothing was more embarraſſed than our
<hi>Cavalier</hi> he was ſo fearful, of giving his Miſtreſs ſome

               </gap> beſt way to conceal their Game was to live

               </gap> and was perfectly convinced of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> great Love, which

               </gap> 
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59476:40"/>in all things without Conſtraint, that,
although ſhe loved him much more then he could imagin, yet ſhe did believe,
that no jealouſy could ever trouble her: That he might really upon theſe
words and hereafter uſe all the liberty, he would do, were he that in Effect,
which he was only in Appearance.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that agrees with Beauty better, or gives it more
luſtre then joy; <hi>Eugenia,</hi> being rid of her vexation, and a gay
humour ſucceeding her Melancholly, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a little time, together with
a good plight, thoſe charms, which formerly rendered her ſo lovely, and
were now ſullied with the trouble and diſquiet of mind, to which her
retreat had reduced her. She ſupt with her Lover, and <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia,</hi>
who was become jealous of the Careſſes, that all the young <hi>Nuns</hi>
made to ſiſter <hi>Aurelia,</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her ſelf, with the
ſenſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of lying, and paſſing the night 
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59476:41"/>with a Perſon, whom ſhe loved with an Extraordinary
tenderneſs, and affection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenia,</hi> that ſhe might have an opportunity of being
ſomtime alone with <hi>Oronces,</hi> undertook her ſelf to go, and make the
Bed, and put in a readineſs the Chamber, wherein he was to remain, untill
another were provided in the Common <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory</hi> of the Convent. The
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed Lover followed her, and was ſufficiently perplexed, to
ſatisfy all the queſtions, which were asked him in a quarter of an hours
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. She immediately asked him, what were his ſentiments, when he
received ſo many kiſſes from the youngeſt, and faireſt in the
houſe. Alas! my dear <hi>Eugenia,</hi> he anſwered, I will diſſemble
nothing from you. 'Tis true, that two or three, who acquitted themſelves with
a great deal of heat, cauſed in me ſome ſlight emotions; ſome Sparkles
of the Fire, wherewith <pb n="77" facs="tcp:59476:41"/>they ſeemed to burn, did warm my
heart, and touched it with ſome ſence of ſweetneſs, which did a little
tickle me.</p>
            <p>How, ſaid ſhe to him, did you not reſiſt that ſpringing
Affection, and condemn in your ſelf a Love, which could not be lawful,
ſince you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it to my prejudice? Ah, he replied, you ought to
excuſe me for ſeveral reaſons, faults, that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in ſpight of
our ſelves, ſhould eaſily be pardoned. Beſides I can aſſure you,
that if theſe Embraces have raiſed in me any paſſions, they were but
wandring ones, which only diſturbed the ſoul, but poſſeſt it not for
any long time. My reaſon is not become irregular upon their account, and the
extream love that I have for you, hath ſuffered no alteration, for your
preſence only hath driven out of my mind, all the Idea's, formed therein by
theſe ſtrange Beauties. I muſt believe you, interrupted <hi>Eugenia,</hi>
and I <pb n="78" facs="tcp:59476:42"/>foreſee well enough, that I muſt prepare my
ſelf to pardon you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the like faults, while you remain here; but for
the reſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, have a care of favouring the weakneſs of any in
this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or of making your ſelf known, and no leſs of requiring from
me, what I will never grant, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Form. All other favours for your
comfort, ſhall not be denied you, and we will live together, as a Brother
would with a Siſter, whom he cheriſhes, and by whom he is equally beloved.
Eſpecially, ſince that we ſhall be obliged to ly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this night, to
avoid the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs of Siſter <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe will
without doubt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you; behave your ſelf diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and
conſider, that your fortune and my Life and Honour, ly upon your following
theſe meaſures, which I give you. Your Father, who is the Principal
obſtacle to our liberty, is very old, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59476:42"/>that I enter'd this Houſe, is known to many, who can upon occaſion
bear witneſs of it, and I hope, that by the aſſiſtance of ſome
powerful friends, we may at length bring about our firſt pretenſions, and
then paſs the reſt of our days in pleaſures, by ſo much the more pure,
as that they will be lawful, and ſhall never more be diſturbed by any
Accident, from the long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them in perfection.</p>
            <p>They were in this Diſcourſe, when <hi>Pamphilia</hi> entered,
who fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them all on fire, demanded how they had over-heated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
<hi>Eugenia</hi> replied, that they were forced to righten the Chamber, for it
was quite ought of Order. Truly, ſaid <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> you are not very
conſcientious, to cauſe ſiſter <hi>Aurelia,</hi> to work thus, could
you not ſtay for company, but muſt tire a poor girl, juſt arrived from a
long journey, and in ſaying that, ſhe caſt her arms about
<hi>Oronces</hi> 
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:59476:43"/>his neck, and gave him a kiſs.
<hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia,</hi> who in ſpight of all her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, did believe, that
her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver robbed her of every thing, that he granted another, could not
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain her ſelf, but would be a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, ſo that our new
<hi>Nun,</hi> was the moſt embarraſſed in the world, to ſatisfy theſe
paſſionated Creatures.</p>
            <p>But this was but a Prelude, or ſlight Attack, if compared with
what was apparently to follow. As ſoon as the retreat was rung, and that all
the <hi>Nuns</hi> were retired each one into her Cell, the two Siſters,
together with the young <hi>Nun,</hi> began the evening with a thouſand
little divertiſing Sports. <hi>Oronces,</hi> who had no experience in the
greater part of theſe Cloyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Games, was almoſt continually out, and
was condemned to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred wanton trifles, which would infinitely have
pleaſed him, had he been at liberty.</p>
            <p>Theſe paſtimes were followed <pb n="81" facs="tcp:59476:43"/>by a
Collation, where Marchpanes, and other delicacies grateful to the taſt,
appeared with profuſion: The moſt tender Airs, out of <hi>Operaes,</hi>
were alſo ſung, and Siſter <hi>Aurelia,</hi> who had a great deal of
skill, performed her part to perfection.</p>
            <p>After having ſpent much time in theſe divertiſements, they
began to talk of going to bed. <hi>Eugenia</hi> had before hand acquainted her
Lover, with all the fooleries he was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, if he lay near
<hi>Pamphilia,</hi> beſides, that it would be impoſſible to do ſo
without diſcovering his Sex. Therefore he was to place him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his
Miſtreſs's ſide; do not imagin, that this was any pleaſure to him, but
quite contrary; for ſhe had impoſed upon him ſuch rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Laws, that he
never paſt a night with leſs repoſe, or more diſquiet than that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> who was almoſt ready to ly down, told
<hi>Eugenia,</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe only had right to ly <pb n="82" facs="tcp:59476:44"/>with Siſter <hi>Aurelia,</hi> having made the firſt proffer; yet
ſhe was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to admit her to a ſhare in the bed, ſo <hi>Aurelia</hi>
lay in the middle.</p>
            <p>Though, according to Rules, a Propoſition, ſo reaſonable as
this, ought to be received without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; yet <hi>Eugenia</hi> would not
agree unto it, foreſeeing as a thing infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, the diſcovery of her
Lover, if it ſhould happen ſo. <hi>Pamphilia</hi> alſo for her part,
being unwillng to yield, had however Complaiſance enough, to offer to decide
the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion by ſome kind of game, which was done, but to the
diſadvantage of <hi>Eugenia,</hi> who loſt and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger knew, what Saint
to invoke, that ſhe might eſcape the danger, wherein ſhe was.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, her naked Companion, after kiſſing
<hi>Aurelia,</hi> went firſt to bed, and left the two Lovers buſy, at
Prayers in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but indeed in contriving ſome Artifice to deliver
themſelves from <pb n="83" facs="tcp:59476:44"/>the Winners perſuites. At length af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having meditated ſome time, <hi>Eugenia</hi> reſolved to put out the
Candle, before ſhe lay down, and to creep readily into the place, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for <hi>Oronces,</hi> and then to ſuffer him by her ſide. She adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
him of it, and ſeeming to ſearch for ſomething with the light, ſhe let
it fall deſignedly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh't the Flame, ſo as
<hi>Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> could obſerve nothing, to make her ſuſpect, that it
was done pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to deceive her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oronces,</hi> who was neer the Bed, and undreſſing, was
called upon by her, who was impatient of being alone, I will come unto you
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, ſaid he, but I deſire you would not trouble my repoſe, it
will be in vain to talk to me; I ſhall not anſwer one word, for I am
already half aſleep.</p>
            <p>He had hardly ended theſe words, when <hi>Eugenia</hi> threw her
ſelf into Bed, and placed her ſelf in the middle, and <pb n="84" facs="tcp:59476:45"/>
               <hi>Oronces</hi> ſoon after lay down by her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pamphilia</hi> no ſooner felt <hi>Eugenia</hi> by her
ſide, but miſtaking her for <hi>Aurelia,</hi> did moſt ſtraitly embrace
her, and demanded of her, if ſhe would not be her Friend? <hi>Eugenia</hi>
anſwered not, but with a kiſs, which ſhe could not ſoon get rid off,
and which was followed with all the Careſſes, and wantonneſs, which the
poor Recluſe are wont to put in practiſe, to aſſwage the heat of their
fire. 'Tis very true, that <hi>Eugenia</hi> did expoſe her ſelf to her
Companions fury, only to deliver her Lover from it, and that ſhe rather
ſought his ſafety, then any ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, which ſhe took therein.</p>
            <p>While the two Siſters were exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing theſe
wantonneſſes, the Poor <hi>Oronces</hi> ſuffered more pain, then they
could taſt pleaſure; he was like <hi>Tantalus,</hi> condemned to die with
hunger, in the ſight of ſeveral dainties, he was Poor in the midſt of
Wealth, and what ſeemed ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <pb n="85" facs="tcp:59476:45"/>to compleat his
joys, was now become the cauſe of his pain and ſorrow.</p>
            <p>He could not reflect upon the condition wherein he was, without
becomming ſenſible of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand importunate thoughts, which tired his
Imagination, and burnt him with a Fire, that he was not permitted to quench,
even upon the brink of a Fountain. He was ſo filled with the Idea of his
Miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes attractions, that all his deſires were fix't upon that
amiable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; all his ſighs half ſtifled, were for her; and all the
motions of his heart had no other cauſe then her Charms.</p>
            <p>He perceived ſometimes his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon growing weak, and without
Heroical endeavours, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been able to reſiſt ſuch
forcible temptations: Alas! what did he not think? What did he not ſay to
himſelf? what torment ſaid he, is this I feel? and whence 
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59476:46"/>proceeds the unquietude and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, wherein I am?
What? muſt I be the moſt unhappy man in the world, for lying by the
faireſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in it? Can ſo fine an object, accuſtomed to inſpire
me with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but joy, put me now to ſo much pain? Ah! how dangerous a
paſſion is Love, and to what rough Tryals do's it expoſe us, before it
imparts unto us, even the leaſt of its pleaſures.</p>
            <p>While he thus thought, <hi>Eugenia,</hi> defending her ſelf from
her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions embraces, did without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering it, approach him with a
great deal of precipitation, it was then, that he being ignorant, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Chance or Love threw her ſo into his Arms, did almoſt forget all the Laws,
preſcribed him, and there wanted little of his committing a fact, contrary to
his duty. This approach did ſenſibly augment his Fires, and the Heat,
received from it, conſumed him even to the very <pb n="87" facs="tcp:59476:46"/>heart,
inſomuch, that though ſhe was retired, yet the remembrance of that
ſurprize did continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double his Affliction; that is, if it were
poſſible to imagine any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to a Grief, which, from the firſt
moment, that he conceived it, had been extream and inſupportable.</p>
            <p>At length, <hi>Pamphilia</hi> cloyed with kiſſes, and wearied
with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of her exerciſe, found her ſelf overcome with ſleep.
She bid her Neighbour Good night, by the name of <hi>Aurelia,</hi> who alſo
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited ſleep, though it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for her to reſt one
moment. She had much ado to conſtrain her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and on what diverſions
ſoever ſhe employed her mind, ſhe could never take it of from her Lover,
her imagination repreſented Him ſo forcibly, that all the various
reflections, to which ſhe applied her ſelf, proved too weak to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
over the violence of her Paſſion; and loving <hi>Oronces</hi> no leſs
then ſhe <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59476:47"/>was beloved by him, ſhe was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of
all the motions, concernes, and tranſports, which Love made him reſent.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Oronces,</hi> ſeeing theſe two
Companions quiet, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that they were really aſleep. So that to eaſe
a little of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream heat, which conſumed him, he laid his hand upon
<hi>Eugenia's</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and for ſome time ran over it with extraordinary
tranſports, which made him forget himſelf, and gave him a taſte of
pleaſures not to be equalled, to his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Satisfaction: His
Miſtreſſe's fear of his being diſcovered by ſome unhappy word, was
the Cauſe, that at firſt ſhe durſt not ſay any thing to him, to
rebuke him; but at length, he became ſo importunate, and his toying provoked
her in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that ſhe could no longer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it, but ſeizing
his hand, ſhe put it off from her, and whiſpered him, as ſoftly as ſhe
could, that <pb n="89" facs="tcp:59476:47"/>he ſhould conſider the danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they
were expoſed; He took that warning, and giving <hi>Eugenia</hi> a kiſs, he
let her underſtand, that he would no more.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more vexatious to Lovers, than to ſpend the
nights after that manner: <hi>Eugenia</hi> would not have <hi>Oronces</hi> to
ly there, until the appearance of day, but, leaſt the light ſhould
diſcover him, ſhe made him riſe, and dreſs himſelf, and gave him the
key of a neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chamber, where he threw himſelf upon a Bed, to take a
little repoſe. After which, ſhe lay in his place, and left the middle
empty, to the end to make her Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion believe, that it was Siſter
<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relia</hi> who had filled it up.</p>
            <p>In effect, <hi>Pamphilia</hi> was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of it, as ſoon as
ſhe awaked, and <hi>Eugenia</hi> acquainted her, that ſhe had ſo tired
and overheated that poor Girle, with her embraces, that ſhe was obliged to
withdraw into <pb n="90" facs="tcp:59476:48"/>another Chamber, for a little reſt, it
being impoſſible for her to ſleep with ſo great heat, and
importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as our two Lovers ſaw each other, <hi>Eugenia</hi>
ſmilingly asked <hi>Oronces,</hi> how he had paſt the night? Ah! malicious
Creature, he replied, have you the heart, ſo to inſult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an unfortunate
man? Know, that I never gave you greater proofs of my Love than laſt night,
and without extream Affection, my Obedience could never have been ſo perfect.
You made me dye a thouſand times by your continual motions, and I ſtill
admire, how I have been able to obſerve with ſo great ſubmiſſion,
thoſe rigorous Laws, which you had given me.</p>
            <p>By this, the time was come, wherein they were to attend all the
uſual exerciſes of a Monaſtick life. <hi>Oronces</hi> was inſtructed in
them by his Miſtreſs, and performed them with ſo great ſucceſs,
eſpecially <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59476:48"/>thoſe that regarded the buſineſs of the
Quire, that in ſome time after, ſhe who had the care of forming the Voices
of the <hi>Novices,</hi> being fallen ſick, that charge was given to
ſiſter <hi>Aurelia,</hi> who took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Employment, and did
execute it to the ſatisfaction of all thoſe, put under him.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that he ſo behaved himſelf, as that under the
Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a <hi>Venus,</hi> he made Virtue it ſelf, and Modeſty
ſhine out. He ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med unmoved with any ambition. His Beauty gave him not
the leaſt pride or affectation. He was ſimple or witty according to
occaſion, and ſo plain a ſincerity appeared in him, that even the moſt
penetrating were deceived.</p>
            <p>Under the Veil of an eaſy and attracting Devotion, he gained the
hearts of all the World; and his Miſtreſs, and himſelf following the
ſame Rules in their Conduct, and being endowed almoſt with the 
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59476:49"/>ſame qualities, they were eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as Perſons, that
one day would fill up the Chief Places of the Convent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenia</hi> was of a tall and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtature, her face
round, and of a wonderful complexion; her black Eyes were filled with Fire,
which ſhe tempered with a great deal of ſweetneſs, and modeſty, her
teeth were white, even, and well ranked. In fine to give a perfect Idea of Her,
it may be ſaid, that her Veil hid more beauty then outwardly appeared, and
that it was reſerved for him only, who one day was to enjoy her, to admire at
its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oronces</hi> had already remained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a year in the
Monaſtery, and lived there, with the Approbation of the whole Convent, when
an unlucky Accident made him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times repent of his raſh entring
into that place, and of truſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo long to the inconſtancy of
Fortune.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:59476:49"/>
            <p>A <hi>Nun</hi> of the houſe, called, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> having
been a little too famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar in private with at Directour, who would conduct her
into Heaven, by ways very different from the Goſpel, ſo reſented his
devout In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, that ſhe could not hide the fruits of it; but
appeared big with Child in the ſight of all her Companions.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that deſtroys the eſteem, which the world
hath conceived for theſe kind of People, more then the knowledge of their
Crimes, and Offences. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kept the buſineſs as ſecret as they
could, and the Superiour forbad them, under great penalties, to ſay any thing
of that diſorder. In the mean time, the poor <hi>Lucia</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
and becauſe, ſhe had read in a Book, containing ſeveral Fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Stories, that a Veſtall had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a Spirit, She thought, that ſhe
alſo might deny her having any communication with a man. <pb n="94" facs="tcp:59476:50"/>In effect, ſhe ſo ſtubbornly perſiſted in the denyal, that
the Superiour, fearing that there might be ſome <hi>Hermaphrodite</hi> among
her maids, ordered ten of the moſt Ancient, to ſearch all the <hi>Nuns</hi>
of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent without exception, and then to make a true Report to her, of
what they had ſeen.</p>
            <p>I leave you to judge, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, this Order reduced our two
Lovers to: <hi>Eugenia,</hi> who fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all things for <hi>Oronces,</hi>
councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to withdraw, and depart that night, through a place in the
Garden, where the paſſage was not difficult. There was ſo little
proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſaving himſelf otherwiſe from the danger, whereto he was
expoſed, that he reſolved to follow the Countel of his dear Miſtreſs,
whom he bid adiew to in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and took leave of her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having
time to reflect upon the means of recovering her, thus abandoned by his
departure.</p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:59476:50"/>
            <p>He was not yet arrived at the place, by which he was to make his
eſcape, when he met a <hi>Nun,</hi> whom chance, or the deſire of taking a
little freſh air had brought thither. She immediately perceived Siſter
<hi>Aurelia,</hi> by reaſon of her Habit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing white mingled with black,
which reaches the ſight, ſooner then any thing elſe, and joyning with
her, retained her in ſpight of all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which ſhe uſed, to get
rid of her.</p>
            <p>She entertained her with what had paſt in the Houſe; and with
what was to be done, on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, according to the command of the Superiour.
Theſe diſcourſes put <hi>Aurelia</hi> upon Thornes. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it
was impoſſible for her to get from that Impertinent, and to add to his
miſfortune, ſhe, who had the charge of locking up all the Gates, came to
adviſe them to retire, that the retreat was rung; and that ſhe came to
perform her office.</p>
            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:59476:51"/>
            <p>This unhappy rencounter broke all the Meaſures of our poor
Lover, he was forced to reenter the <hi>Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and go to his own
bed, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually how to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the ſtorm and
tempeſt, which threatned him. But alas! that Wit, that ſuggeſted to him
his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Stratagem, failed him upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenia,</hi> perceiving him in the morning, in the Quire
among the reſt, was in the greateſt amazement in the world. The ſearch
was to be made in the Afternoon, and there was no poſſibility of eſcaping
by day the ſight of ſo many people. She ſpoke to him, and underſtood,
what had hindred his departure, ſhe thought, ſhe ſtudied, ſhe
meditated, but ſtill in vain, and in that diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, ſhe remitted her
cauſe to the God of love, whom ſhe conjured, not to abandon them in ſo
dangerous an extremity.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <pb n="97" facs="tcp:59476:51"/>for the
execution of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donnance being come, all the <hi>Nuns</hi> had freſh
notice, to go and preſent themſelves, one after another, to the old ones
deputed to ſearch, and ſeveral had already undergone that mortification,
when <hi>Eugenia</hi> came thither, and retired as ſoon as ſhe could out of
the hands of thoſe old Matrons, whoſe faſhions would have made her laugh,
had ſhe not had ſo much cauſe of affliction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oronces</hi> his turn approached, when <hi>Eugenia</hi>
perceiving her ſelf all of a ſuddain tranſported, went to find him out
and readily changing Habits with him (which differed from the reſt) as we
have already told you, ſhe bid him not to torment himſelf; and ſaid, that
ſhe hoped, that with this diſguiſe every thing would fall out to their
advantage.</p>
            <p>In effect ſhe went again, to preſent herſelf, with her Veil
dow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n before theſe
Venerable Dames, who took her, by the White and Black Habit, 
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59476:52"/>which ſhe wore, for ſiſter <hi>Aurelia.</hi> She
being eſteemed very vertuous, they believed that it was modeſty, obliged
her to be ſo Veiled, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would not vex her with any demand,
but putting their ſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles upon their noſes and taking their candles in
hand, they viſited that fair place with a great deal of diligence, which they
could not know again, though they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly viewed it juſt a little
before. Being ſo eſcaped from the danger, ſhe went immediately to
<hi>Oronces,</hi> and reſtored to him his Garments, aſſuring him, that
there was nothing more to be feared: then he gave a thouſand Kiſſes to
this witty Lover, and at the ſame time, they both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, to go together
to <hi>Rome,</hi> to the end, to annul the vows by which <hi>Eugenia</hi> was
engaged, and to have her remitted in her former li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>The good Matrons made their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the Superiour, and ſaid,
that <pb n="99" facs="tcp:59476:52"/>although they had ſeen great matters, yet that they
had perceived nothing capable of giving Siſter <hi>Lucia</hi> the Tympany,
that incommoded her; that the miſchief muſt have come from without, and
that by uſing a little cunning to convict her, they might diſcover, who had
been the Author of ſo great a ſcandal. This advice was followed with
ſucceſs, for <hi>Lucia</hi> fell into the ſnare laid for her, and became
obliged to confeſs her fault without any diſguiſe.</p>
            <p>A little time after his had paſt, <hi>Oronces</hi>'s Fathers
death was publiſhed over all the Town, though our Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw himſelf by
it, at more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than before, yet he reſented it very much, and his
natural tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made him, in ſecret, ſhed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ance of tears, to the Memory of him, who had
given him life.</p>
            <p>In the interim, his elder brother<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hearing that he was no longer in the Army,
cauſed him to be enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on all ſides, and the report of it 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59476:53"/>being come to the Monaſtery, where he was, upon the
account of his Miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs ſhut up in it, they thought it time, to contrive
their retreat, leaſt ſome Misfortune ſhould diſcover them to thoſe,
who made ſuch curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enquiries after their Perſons.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more induſtrious than Love, <hi>Eugenia</hi> found a
way to have two Gentile ſuits of man's appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, by the means of a Confident
whom ſhe had abroad, telling her, that ſhe had a deſign to make
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of them to two of her Cozens, who were almoſt of the ſame
ſtature, but becauſe ſhe would ſurprize them with that liberality,
ſhe purpoſed to keep the matter ſecret. This Friend, not knowing any
thing conſiderable of her Amours, could not imagin the uſe ſhe would put
theſe Garments to, but did unfeignedly believe what was told her, and within
three days ſhe delivered them ready made and finiſht, into her hands, who
had given her Orders about them.</p>
            <pb n="101" facs="tcp:59476:53"/>
            <p>As ſoon as theſe two Lovers had wherewithall to ſhift their
Habits, they thought of nothing more than of their departure. <hi>Oronces</hi>
had brought with him two hundred Piſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olls, which the war had enriched him
with. Theſe he had always preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a time of neceſſity, and it
was wiſely done, for they were of great uſe to him in the journey, which he
now undertook. After that both had made themſelves ready, and taken with them
what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, they departed about nine of the clock in the Evening,
through that place, already mentioned, in the Garden, and went immediately by
favour of the night to put on their new Equipage.</p>
            <p>The fear they were in of being known in the Town, made them walk a
quarter of a league a foot, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they arrived in a Village, where
having taken lodging u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>der
borrowed names, they hired two Horſes, to depart on the break of 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59476:54"/>day. Though the young <hi>Eugenia</hi> was not
accuſtomed to this kind of riding, yet her addreſs was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous, and
ſhe would have given thoſe, who did not know her, reaſon to believe, that
ſhe had performed all her exerciſes in the <hi>Academie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whil'ſt our two Fugitives made all the haſt they could to
<hi>Marſeilles,</hi> the whole Monaſtery, from which they ran away, was in
diſorder. It ſeemed that all the Furies were let looſe againſt them, by
reaſon of the continual misfortunes, that aſſaulted them, and of the
irregularity that became ſo publick. In this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture they knew not what
to ſay of the preſent ſcandal, nor think what might be the cauſe of it.
They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dreamt of <hi>Oronces,</hi> and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he and
<hi>Eugenia</hi> had beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves in the Houſe, added to the
ſurprize of all the Religious.</p>
            <p>Several People were ſent after them, but in vain, for beſides
that they had taken a way quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <pb n="103" facs="tcp:59476:54"/>to that by

and before it came to the knowledge of Secular Perſons, who cauſed the

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia</hi>'s ſorrow, it was
ſo much the more in that ſhe knew, that ſhe her ſelf had occaſioned
by her conſtraint all this irregularity, and had forced her Daughter, to
incloſe her ſelf in a place, for which ſhe had never had any inclination.
Let us leave her to deplore the loſs of her dear <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and
follow the way of our Lovers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oronces</hi> having been ſo happy as to find at
<hi>Marſeilles</hi> a Veſſel ready to ſaile to <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi>
he embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued therein, together with his Miſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, and made proviſion of
all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for their voyage. The wind was ſo favourable, that in
two days they arrived at <hi>Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a,</hi> where after <pb n="104" facs="tcp:59476:55"/>taking ſome
refreſhment, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, that they might not loſe the opportunity of
the fair weather. But alas! the more they advanced, the nearer they approached
their ruin. The weather changed in a moment, and a ſtorm ſucceeded the fair
day they had had, and the violent agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Waves threatned nothing
leſs, than an aſſured Shipwrack. It was in vain that in this
diſaſter, the <hi>Pilots</hi> and <hi>Mariners</hi> endeavoured to recover
the Coaſt, which was too farr off. They muſt yield to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, and
place all their hopes in him, who alone can command that fierce Element, and be
obeyed. In the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, <hi>Eugenia,</hi> more dead than alive, lay extended
betwen her Loversarms, who, though he himſelf was no leſs afflicted,
endeavoured to comfort her by all the reaſons, which his troubled Spirit
could afford him, in this lamentable confuſion.</p>
            <p>But the night, which the <hi>Pilots</hi> drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded moſt, proved
not ſo vexatious, as <pb n="105" facs="tcp:59476:55"/>was feared. The wind ſuddainly
aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Sky, diſcloſing ſome Stars, gave them a little comfort,
promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them according to apparencies, weather proper to perſue their
voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. In effect they weighed anchor in the Dawn, and having fitted the Ship,
they ſayled away, ſinging a thouſand ſongs of joy, which made them
forget their paſt dangers.</p>
            <p>But alas! how ſhort was their joy, and what hardſhip did their
ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſtill provide for them? They ſcarce began to enjoy that
interval of fair Weather, when they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves expoſed to a danger,
a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more tormenting, than that which they had ſo luckily
eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped. They perceived from far a <hi>Corſaire,</hi> who, rightly
gueſſing that the Tempeſt would ſcatter ſome Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels upon their
Coaſts, lay in wait for them, and already made appear by his motions, that he
looked upon this Ship, as an infallible Prey.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, who guided the Veſſel, <pb n="106" facs="tcp:59476:56"/>where our
Lovers were, gave them notice of the miſfortune threatning them, and of the
ſlavery, to which they ſhould be reduced, if they fell into the hands of
the <hi>Corſair,</hi> whom they perceived out at Sea. Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is an evil a
thouſand times more inſupportable, to a well born Soul, than death it
ſelf. Now crys and lamentations only were to be heard, and this news began to
put all things in diſorder, but this as yet was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in compariſon of
what paſt, when they ſaw that the <hi>Barbarian</hi> bore up with full
ſail towards them; and that it was impoſſible to ſave themſelves. Had
<hi>Oronces</hi> not been there, <hi>Eugenia</hi> would have flung her ſelf
into the Waters; the evident loſs of her liberty and honour, made her
eſteem death much more agreeable, than the rude conſtraints, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
violences, to which, ſhe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, ſhe was going to be ſubjected.</p>
            <p>Though in this to be pitied con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, her Lover was nearer death
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59476:56"/>than life, yet he comforted her, with giving her hopes,
that ſhe might eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape undiſcovered in the Habit, which ſhe wore,
ſince it was not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to her Sex. That it was not without example,
that captives have found clemency from thoſe kind of People, and that Love,
who had drawn them out of a infinity of troubles, would not now forſake them
in a rencounter, where his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour was abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>air</hi> came up to them, and obliged them to
lowre their Sails, and ſhot of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral pieces of Cannon, to fright them,
the others, not being in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to defend themſelves againſt ſuch
powerful Enemies, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to yield to their force, and to receive
into their Ship thoſe, who were about to enſlave them. As ſoon as the
<hi>Barbarian</hi> was entered, he was raviſhed with the beauty of our two
young <hi>Cavaliers;</hi> he enquired of what Nation they were, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59476:57"/>they deſigned to go. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that they were
two Brothers, born in <hi>France,</hi> and that they had departed thence to
travel into <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>African,</hi> who underſtood the
Language, was charmed with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging and reſpectful air, wherewith they
had anſwered him; he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe fair youths before all the reſt of
his Prey, and for their ſake, all thoſe of their Company were treated with
leſs, in humanity, than is uſual in the like accidents. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they were forced to put on Irons in order to prevent all deſigns, that
deſpair might inſpire them with, in ſo vexatious a conjuncture.
<hi>Oronces</hi> and <hi>Eugenia,</hi> being more favoured by the
<hi>Barbarian,</hi> and having diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled their affliction, were exempted
from the Chains, and took for a good Omen, theſe firſt favours, which made
them, as it were, ſtill enjoy an entire liberty.</p>
            <p>Theſe poor unfortunate creatures, were brought to
<hi>Tripoly,</hi> and were <pb n="109" facs="tcp:59476:57"/>all expoſed to ſale, except
our two <hi>French</hi> men, and to change their their Maſter, as ſoon as
they arrived there. The <hi>Corſair,</hi> knowing by the Carriage, Manners,
and Habits of the two Brothers, that they were not of the common ſort, would
keep them himſelf, and always treated them, as Perſons of the firſt
Quality, and from whom, he expected a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Ranſome. So that it
might be ſaid, that they were free in their ſlavery, and that they might
reliſh the ſame ſweets, as they heretofore found in their entertainments,
when they were without impriſonment or conſtraint.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, all this good uſage was capable only of
leſsning their trouble, but not of freeing them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together from it. The
remembrance of what they were, and their ſhame and confuſion to diſcover
to their Relations what had hapned to them, tormented their mind more than I
can expreſs. They even reſolved not <pb n="110" facs="tcp:59476:58"/>to ſend them any
account, or news of themſelves; but choſe rather to reſigne themſelves
to Fortune, that does often pleaſe it ſelf in delivering the miſerable
out of Dungeons, to raiſe them up to Thrones, than have recourſe to
perſons, who would not relieve them, until they had paſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
cenſures upon their conduct.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Corſair,</hi> who expected
ſuddainly to receive money for their deliverance, began to grow impatient at
the delay, and he had already entertained them four Months, without obliging
them to any employment, diſagreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. He again demanded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there were any thing to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them? <hi>Oronces</hi> anſwered
him, that they acknowledged him for their Maſter, that they were at his
diſcretion, and that they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that none were diſpoſed to
ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome-them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Barbarian,</hi> whom the Hopes of Gain, rather then the
Luſtre of <pb n="111" facs="tcp:59476:58"/>Beauty had moved to the clemency uſed
towards them, was very much ſurprized with that anſwer, and told them
coldly, that they might then diſpoſe themſelves to change their dwelling,
ſince that, they being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for any labour, he would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer
maintain unprofitable people in his Houſe. In effect he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them to
ſale in the firſt Markets.</p>
            <p>For you muſt know, that amongſt theſe Infidels, men are not
in a much happier condition, than beaſts; and that they are there bought and
ſold, after the ſame manner, as Animals void of reaſon are with us.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as our <hi>Pirate</hi> had expoſed the two Young
<hi>French</hi> men to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſale, they were encompaſſed by a number
of Perſons, who, judging by their meen, that they would be ſold at a dear
rate, approached them more to admire their Beauty, than to make any proffer.
Nevertheleſs, there were ſome, who endeavoured to become Maſters of them,
but the <pb n="112" facs="tcp:59476:59"/>
               <hi>Corſaire,</hi> who took them, deſiring to
be reimburſed of the Expences which he had been at in their Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
put ſo high a prize upon them, that they ſtill ſtuck upon his hands.</p>
            <p>Whilſt that the <hi>African</hi> was in paine, to be with
advantage rid of his Captives, he received news of the arrival of a Ship from
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſent by a <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> or Governour of the
Country, to tranſport Slaves, that were to be bought at <hi>Tripoly,</hi> but
above all he was overjoyed, when he underſtood from the Captain, that he had
order to ſearch for all the Fair Youths, that he could find, to carry to his
Maſter, who had a deſign to make a Preſent of them to the
<hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He imparted theſe news to our two Lovers, telling them that they
were very much favoured by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, in that they had fallen into no other
hands than his, from whom they had not received any ill enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and
that they parted not <pb n="113" facs="tcp:59476:59"/>from him, but to be yet more happy,
ſince they were deſtined for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a Prince, who acknowledged
no man above him, but the Grand Seigniour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenia,</hi> who underſtood not the <hi>Barbarians</hi>
meaning, received much joy at theſe news, but when <hi>Oronces,</hi> who was
a little more knowing, had told her what he conceived, ſhe was not to be
comforted, and wiſh't that an exceſſive Uglineſs might ſucceed her
great Beauty, and that by ſome happy Metamorphoſis, the charms of her Youth
might be changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the horrid wrinkles of old Age. Her Lover did not differ
from her in his wiſhes, but theſe were all in vain. Appear they muſt
before him, who was to buy them, if he approved of them.</p>
            <p>Though they ſtood in no need of Ornaments, to pleaſe thoſe
who loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon them; yet they were cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in Veſts of Silk, branched all
over with Gold, and wore upon their <pb n="114" facs="tcp:59476:60"/>heads a
<hi>Turbant</hi> after the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Faſhion, and in that dreſs were
brought to the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Captain. Theſe Garments, which were very
ſplendid, did not a little ſet of the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our two young Captives;
and they received from them ſo great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that the Captain was
char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and gave the <hi>Tripolin</hi> his own price for their Perſons.</p>
            <p>See here <hi>Oronces</hi> and <hi>Eugenia</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſail
for <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for ever deprived of the
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, vvhich they hoped for, in once more ſeeing their own Country.
Yet they durſt not diſcover their Melancholy, for fear of rendring
themſeves more miſerable. They gave the night only to their tears, and
ſome ſecret Moments which they as it were ſtole, to eaſe their hearts
of thoſe Pains and Tortures, which they felt within.</p>
            <p>They being deſtined for the <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſas</hi> pleaſure, you
may be ſure that they were not ill treated by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, 
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59476:60"/>who conſidered them, as men one day likely to become
Favorits to his Prince, rather then as unhappy Slaves: he granted them every
thing they deſired, and forgot nothing that might contribute to their
ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They eat at his Table, which he cauſed to be ſerved with
the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious dainties, and meats moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to preſerve them
freſh and fair.</p>
            <p>But alas! all theſe favours did not at all touch the hearts of
our Lovers, they ſtifled a thouſand ſighs within themſelves, when they
outwardly appeared any thing joyful; and the reflection, which they made upon
their Fate, fretted them with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and inſpired them with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but
ſentiments of deſpair, to which, without particular Grace, they had without
doubt abandoned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>They were fifteen days in the <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>Tripoly,</hi>
ere the wind ſtood fair for their departure. This gave them much joy, but it
continued not long <pb n="116" facs="tcp:59476:61"/>for on the ſixteenth, it changed and
became favourable. The <hi>Egyptian</hi> Captain, who deſired nothing more,
than to return preſently to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> to make his Merchandiſe
be there admired, cauſed the Anchors forthwith to be weighed, and with ful
ſails departed, not deſigning to go far until they had attained the ſight
of the neighbouring <hi>Promontory</hi> of the ſmall Iſle of Lea.</p>
            <p>The beginning of their voyage, was ſo proſperous, that on the
firſt night they came within ſight of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> which is more than
an hundred and fifty miles diſtant from the place whence they ſet out. All
who were in the Ship, rejoyced at this good ſpeed. Our Lovers alone
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſad, and regarded themſelves as poor Victims, who were to be
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to the Brutality of a Prince, if God by ſome extraordinary
effect of his power, did not deliver them from the evident danger that came
every moment nearer and nearer to them.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:59476:61"/>
            <p>In fine their Tears and Prayers ſcended even to Heaven; the Wind
changed in an inſtant, and became ſo fierce, that the <hi>Pilots</hi> were
obliged to turne their Courſe back again, and to ſeek out ſome harbour,
to ſhelter from the Storme, wherewith they were menaced. But the danger
preſt them on all ſides, for they could not ſtay at <hi>Pontia,</hi>
without expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Banks of Sands, that encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed them:
They could not alſo go far from thence, without approaching <hi>Malta,</hi>
which belonged to their moſt untractable enemies. In this confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they
judged it more proper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from the ſands among which it was
impoſſible to avoid Shipwrack, and to advance towards the Iſle, where
nothing was to be feared, if they could eſcape unperceived.</p>
            <p>But they had hardly ſhifted Sails that way, when they were
diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by three Galleys and a man of War, belonging to the Iſland,
which having deceived them with a falſe <pb n="118" facs="tcp:59476:62"/>Flag, attack't
them ſo unexpectedly that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Captain, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to
defend himſelf againſt ſo great a Force, was obliged to yield up
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his Slaves, Ship and all.</p>
            <p>Then our Lovers began to breath again when they ſaw themſelves
in the hands of Chriſtians, and at the diſpoſal of a Nobility ſo
generous, as are the Knights of <hi>Malta. Oronces,</hi> who had a Kinſman in
that Order, made himſelf known immediately, and received from the Great
Maſter, and all the <hi>French</hi> Knights then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, all the Honour
and fair enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, which his good Fortune had prepared for him. He told
them a part of his adventures, and declared the deſign the had of going to
<hi>Rome,</hi> along with the Gentleman that bore him Company, yet he could not
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſtaying ſome days among thoſe of his own Nation, who had a
deſire to retain him for a longer time; but the opportunity of departing in a
Galley, which had lately tranſported <pb n="119" facs="tcp:59476:62"/>an <hi>Italian</hi>
Prince, ſeparated them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter returning a thouſand thanks to the Great
Maſter, and taking leave of the other Knights, who had ſo kindly
entertained them.</p>
            <p>It was in this Voyage, that Love, victorious over Fortune, happily
con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ducted theſe two delivered Captives. They paſt the ſtraights of
<hi>Meſſina,</hi> and after having coaſted part of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labria,</hi>
and paſt within ſight of <hi>Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> they arrived at the Port of
<hi>Oſtia,</hi> from whence they went to <hi>Rome,</hi> with Letters of
Recommendation to a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> who was Brother to the <hi>Italian</hi>
Prince, we mentioned.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were arrived in Town, they earneſtly
ſollicited their buſineſs, and <hi>Eugenia</hi> having made a declaration
of the manner, that ſhe entered into Religion, and of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, that
had cauſed her to make her Vows, <hi>Oronces</hi> preſented it to the
<hi>Cardinal,</hi> that he was recommended to; he gained his favour, and
related to him every thing that he had done, <pb n="120" facs="tcp:59476:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>for
that Lady, and the hazards which he had run through. The recital of ſo many
misfortunes ſo moved the heart of this Lord, that he cauſed all the
proceedings of her Profeſſion to be made null and void, and replaced her in
her former liberty.</p>
            <p>After this they returned into <hi>France,</hi> where their
Marriage was celebrated, with ſo much the more joy, as that the Elder brother
of <hi>Oronces,</hi> having been killed in a Duel, left him the only heir to
all the Eſtate of his Family, and ſo obtained <hi>Laurentia</hi>'s
conſent, (who was overjoyed to ſee again her dear <hi>Eugenia</hi>) yet
ſhe never would have given it, but that ſhe could no longer refuſe it,
without oppoſing her Daughters advantage. Pomp, ſports, and mirth
accompanied the Nuptials of our Lovers. The Feaſt was publick and the
Pleaſures of ſucceſsful Love was to both of them the more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in
that they had ſtrugled with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite obſtacles, which now they had happily
overcome.</p>
